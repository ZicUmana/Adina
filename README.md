The web app serves as a digital storefront, featuring an elegant menu display, online reservations, and a gallery of signature dishes. Its simplicity ensures that visitors can quickly find essential information, while subtle animations and a warm color palette echo the restaurant’s ambiance.

Behind this simplicity lies a commitment to clean code. We adhered to principles that make the codebase readable, maintainable, and scalable:

Meaningful naming: Variables, functions, and classes are named descriptively (e.g., fetchDailySpecials, reservationForm) to make the code self-documenting.

Modular structure: The app is divided into small, focused modules (HTML templates, CSS components, JavaScript controllers) that can be updated independently.

Consistent formatting: We used a linter (ESLint) and a formatter (Prettier) to ensure uniform indentation, spacing, and syntax across the project.

DRY principle: Repeated logic was abstracted into reusable functions (e.g., for form validation, API calls).

Accessible and semantic HTML: Tags like <nav>, <article>, and <button> were used appropriately, improving both SEO and screen reader compatibility.

Comments only where necessary: We avoided over-commenting, relying on clear code to convey intent, and added comments only for complex algorithms or workarounds.

The result is a lightweight, responsive web app that loads quickly and is easy to enhance—just like a well-prepared dish at Adina, it’s simple on the surface but crafted with care underneath.
